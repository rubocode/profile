## Cirrato Technologies

Cirrato was a startup based in Stockholm.  They developed a Single Server Print Management System eliminating the need for intermediate printer spoolers.
The product managed hundreds of sophisticated printers for large customers and included automatic printer driver management.

I worked on several components of the product, programming primarily in C++.  I worked with them for six years.  The company was later acquired by LRS, Inc., a US-based company.
