I am a Strategy Consultant residing in Sri Lanka.
I graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, USA
as a Computer Engineer with a minor in Philosophy in 1996.  

I have more than a quarter of a century of experience in software development,
starting at Salomon Brothers in New Jersey and New York working with Trading
Systems in C++.  

Currently I spend time studying General Purpose Languages, Operating Systems
and Systems Design with emphasis on simplicity, elegance, semantics and evolution.
It is good to reflect on your past experience and have a critical look at current
developments in the industry.

My general interests revolve around Philosophy, Psychology, Strategy and Systems.

I am an [INTP](/mbti/types/intp).
