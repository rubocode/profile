## Philosophy Minor

Stevens had a Humanities requirement.  You had to take eight humanities subjects in your four years.  If you took nine and selected five out of them in one specific area, you could get a minor.  I minored in Philosophy with guidance from [Professor Jim Scow](scow).

Here are the nine subjects I took:

| HU&nbsp;111 | Philosophy I |
| HU&nbsp;112 | Philosophy II |
| HU&nbsp;339 | Ethics |
| HU&nbsp;347 | Theories of Logic, Knowledge and Reality |
| HU&nbsp;372 | Old Regime and The French Revolution |
| HU&nbsp;375 | History of Psychology |
| HU&nbsp;376 | Theories of Personality |
| HU&nbsp;443 | Philosophy of Language |
| HU&nbsp;499 | Tutorial (Philosophy) |
