## Professor Stephen Bloom

Professor Bloom taught me Data Structures and Algorithms as well as The Theory of Computation (Automata Theory).

He would just come to the class empty-handed, knew exactly where he stopped last time and would proceed to completely astound you.  He would ask a question a couple of times and then go "come on, my dog can do this in three seconds!"

He also had the habit of getting us to think critically.  At the end or on the way to a proof or some other result, he would ask: "so,&nbsp;what?"  In other words, "what do you think is the big deal in that?"

Computing is a specific discipline under [Systems](/profile/interests/systems) and the study of Algorithms informs [Strategy](/profile/interests/strategy) in significant ways.
