## Professor James Scow

Professor Scow was kind, humble and wise &mdash; a mentor of significant influence in my life.

I had never studied [Philosophy](/profile/interests/philosophy) in my life when I took _Philosophy I_ with him during my very first semester at Stevens.  I was hooked.

Philosophy informs [Systems](/profile/interests/systems) and [Strategy](/profile/interests/strategy) as well.
