## Geology Division

I worked in the Geology Division with Dr.&nbsp;G.M.&nbsp;Fonseka who was in-charge of the X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD).

Crushed soil samples are compacted inside metal rings into discs and mounted on the XRD.  Then the sample is hit with x-rays.  The resulting diffracted x-rays provide clues into the Bragg planes in the material in the sample.  This helps identify the component elements in the sample.  

One of my projects was to translate a booklet on X-Ray Diffractometry into Sinhalese for the School Science Program under Dr.&nbsp;Fonseka's supervision.
