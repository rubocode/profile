## Computer Division

At the IFS, there was a Data General MV/7800 Eclipse mini computer, a Japanese donation.  It ran Advanced Operating System / Virtual Storage (AOS/VS), a UNIX-like operating system.  I was the System Operator.

This is where I first learnt the C Programming Language.  I learnt Fortran 77 as well.  But C took the cake.
I also learnt Donald Knuth's TeX Typesetting System.
