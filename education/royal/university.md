## University Entrance

Studying at [Royal College](/profile/education/royal), I obtained 3 As and a C in the Mathematics stream at the G.C.E. (A/L) examination in 1988.  I gained entry into the University of Moratuwa in the Engineering I category.

However, due to civil unrest in the country at the time all universities were closed for more than 3 years.  I joined the [Institute of Fundamental Studies (IFS)](/profile/education/ifs) in 1989.

I completed the SAT and achievement tests to gain entry into university studies in the USA.  I obtained full marks (800/800) each for Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in the achievement tests.

I was offered a scholarship at [Stevens Institute of Technology](/profile/education/stevens) in 1990.
