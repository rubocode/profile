## Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM)

In 2015, I decided to pursue an MBA.  I joined PIM for that purpose.

I found the subjects of Leadership, Entrepreneurship, Marketing and Strategy to be extremely interesting.  Yet, I found the study methodology quite draining.  I found that I hated the examinations.  So, after the first year, I stopped sitting the exams.  I continued to audit the classes afterwards.

Obvioiusly, I am considered a drop-out.  But hey, I would join the ranks of the Steve Jobs' of the world in a small way.  Why not!
