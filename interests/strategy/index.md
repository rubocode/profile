## Strategy

Strategy is about how we act.  It is about how we decide on and achieve our aims.

What are we trying to accomplish?  Why and how did we decide on that?
Do we have any obstacles?  What is really important here?

What is the challenge at hand?  What kind of policy could guide us?
Can we act coherently over time?

Strategy, ultimately, is about how we win, how we succeed.
