## Philosophy

> Beware of false knowledge; it is more dangerous than ignorance.  
> **George Bernard Shaw**

Philosophy is about how we think.  It is concerned with the questions of life.
What do we know?  How do we know that?  Why are things the way they are?
Are we sure about that?

Is there a God?  How do we know that?  What do you mean by the word God anyway?
Is everything happening by cause and effect?  Doesn't that mean that I can't change what happens at all?
Do we have free will?  Are we living inside a simulation?

Knowing that you may die on any given day, what could you count as living well?

Philosophy, ultimately,  is an attempt to understand who we are and what we are doing here.
