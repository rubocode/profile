## Psychology

> Sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think, I’m not going to make it.  
> But you laugh inside remembering all the times you’ve felt that way.  
**Charles Bukowski**

Psychology is about how we feel. It is concerned with perception and perspective and how we could transform how we feel.

How much of who I am is nature (genetically) determined?
How much is nurture (culturally) determined?

Am I the same as everyone else or am I unique?
What is my unique contribution to the world? 

What are my desires?
What are my intentions?
Are they meaningful?
What purpose do they serve?

Psychology, ultimately, is life as we experience it.
