## Systems

> No theory, no plan, no system of government can assure the success of an enterprise.  
> Only people can do that.  
**Akio Morita**

Systems are about order. Some systems are natural, others are designed by humans.

The focus of systems is to organize and maintain order.  In natural systems, there is a natural balance.

When we try to bring order into chaos, we need to design for purpose and harmony.

Systems, ultimately, manage intent.
