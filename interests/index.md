History is filled with people of wisdom, many of them in the category of polymath.
Today, we seem to be pre-occupied with creating narrow specialists.
Classical education dealt with intelligence in a much different way than now.
When you study a multitude of fields, you have to integrate your knowledge into
:a whole that makes sense.

A polymath is a person who has mastered multiple disciplines.
He is a specialist and a generalist simultaneously.
He has integrated knowledge.
He can see a problem or a situation from multiple angles.
He can provide creative solutions.

It is not the same set of disciplines for different polymaths.
They master a set of disciplines with their particular uniqueness in talents.
In classical education this was expected of each wise man.
Our modern times tend to focus on too narrow a scope for specialization.

[Intelligence](intelligence) is also a worthwhile interest to pursue,
especially in this age.

Polymathy is not for everyone.
